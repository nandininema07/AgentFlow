    - Clarity: The email should be easy to understand and free of jargon. Use clear and concise language to convey the intended message.
    - Engagement: The email should be engaging and capture the reader's attention. Use persuasive language and a compelling call to action where appropriate.

    - Tone Consistency: Maintain the specified tone throughout the email. Avoid abrupt shifts in tone or style.
    - Call to Action (if applicable): If the email requires the recipient to take action, include a clear and concise call to action. Make it easy for the recipient to understand what you want them to do.
    - Subject Line Optimization: Ensure the subject line accurately reflects the email's content and is likely to encourage the recipient to open the email. If a subject is not given, create one that is optimized for open rates based on the content.

    - Do not include any personal opinions or biases.
